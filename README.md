# work-day-scheduler

# User Story:
As an employee with a hectic schedule,
I'd like to include essential events in a daily planner,
So I can effectively manage my time.

# Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I'm utilizing a daily planner to create a schedule,
When I open the planner,
Then the current day should be prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.

When I scroll down,
Then I should be presented with time blocks corresponding to standard business hours, from 9 am to 5 pm.

When I review the time blocks for that specific day,
Then each time block should be color-coded to indicate whether it falls in the past, present, or future.

When I click on a time block,
Then I should be able to input an event.

When I click the save button for that particular time block,
Then the event text should be saved in local storage.

When I refresh the page,
Then the saved events should persist.
